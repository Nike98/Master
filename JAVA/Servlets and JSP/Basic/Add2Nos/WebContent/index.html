	This whole app is an example fort showing the viewer the 
	way of using JAVA Servlets in the most basic way.
	
	It includes taking numerical input from the User and 
	printing the sum of those inputs.
	
	The <<AddServlet>> class includes doing this operation
	by the most basic way and by default way the
	info/values is processed is by using the GET method.
	
	But to portray this in a more specific way, the 
	<<UsingGET>> and <<UsingPOST>> classes are made to 
	show the difference clearly.
	
	The <<UsingGET>> class processes the information
	using the GET method strictly.
	
	The <<UsingPOST>> class processes the information
	using the POST method strictly.
