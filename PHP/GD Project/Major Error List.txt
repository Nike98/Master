1. PROBLEM:  While working on the main interface, a file "CRUD.php" was created to handle all the CRUD interactions with 
    the database. The PHP file had all the credentials to connect to the Database.

    AREA: These creadentials were wrong as per the my knowledge about my system.

    REASON : The reason for this was that it was a new interface for me.

    SOLUTION: Had to look up a few videos on youtube and found the way to change the password of the MYSQL localhost

2. PROBLEM: The Student Name was not being displayed in the modal when called through the JSON Array on clicking Edit Button

    AREA: The browser was not able to parse it due to some issues

    SOLUTION: Had to check the network section in the Browser Developer mode. Did a few page reloads and
                checked the interaction of the Dashboard page with the CRUD.php there, whether it was
                generating the required JSON Array or not. After multiple reloads it started working

3. PROBLEM: The login Page is not working properly due to some code and internal object response issues. When given
            wrong input doesn't display failed to login, but when the credentials are correct, it does login and
            navigate the user to the Dashboard Page.

4. PROBLEM: The Logout button on the Dashboard page doesn't respond immediately. It requires 2 click to respond.
