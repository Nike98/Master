    Exotic Apple-Cookie Pie

        a great holiday idea!

        Follow Apple Cookie Recipe as above.
        Also need a standard graham-cracker pie crust. Available pre-made at the
        grocery store.

        After mixing all the ingredients, press dough into the graham-cracker pie crust,
        about 1-2 cm deep (don't make too deep or it won't cook evenly). Extra
        dough can be used to make cookies.
